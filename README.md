# Project README

## Overview

This project involves data analysis and modeling with both **R** and **Python**. The R code contains steps to perform data processing, feature engineering, regression analysis, and random forest modeling while the Python code provides a simple way to run the ANN models after installing the necessary packages.

## Instructions

### Running the R Code

1. **Open the R script** in your R environment (RStudio or any other IDE).
2. **Run the script line by line**, ensuring each step completes successfully before moving to the next.
   - The script processes the data, performs feature engineering, and applies regression analysis (skip the regression section if not needed).
3. **Note**: If you choose to skip the regression section as we didn't mention it in the report, proceed with the other steps for data cleaning, feature selection, and model training.

### Running the Python Code

**Run the Python Script**:
   After installing the packages, simply **run the Python script**. It will automatically load the data, process it, and train the models.
   
   You can execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

### Notes

- The **R script** includes an optional regression section. You can skip this part if regression analysis is not required for your check.
- In the **Python script**, all necessary functions will be called automatically once the script is executed, so you don't need to manually run individual lines.
- Make sure you have the correct paths to the data files or any other required resources.
